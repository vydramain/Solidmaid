# Solidmaid: Alkoldun Vasiliusavich

**Description**

*Solidmaid: Alkoldun Vasiliusavich* is a 2D pixel art beat'em up game set in an alternate 1990s Russia, blending gritty post-Soviet vibes with Russian folklore. Play as Vasiliusavich, a mystical alcoholic navigating a procedurally generated street filled with foes like gopniks, leshy-dachnitsy, and other quirky enemies. Buff up with alcohol and snacks, fight at lampposts, and multitask at the factory to craft lampposts while battling bosses. With roguelite progression, tactical lamppost upgrades, and a satirical twist, this game offers replayable chaos and humor.
