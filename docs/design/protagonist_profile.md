# Protagonist Visual Design Brief

Alkoldun Vasiliusavich — folk-horror FPS protagonist, post-Soviet factory worker awakening latent mage undertones.

## 1. Morphology
- **Stature:** Real-world average height but staged as a tall, narrow silhouette to mirror the approved pixel-art reference.
- **Build:** Normal worker physique—neither athletic nor frail, kept intentionally unheroic.
- **Age Impression:** Around 35 years old, visibly worn by decades of shift work.
- **Skin Tone:** Pale complexion that hints at limited sunlight.
- **Face:** Angular face with visible stubble; eyes remain hidden beneath greasy, dark hair that drapes forward in stylized anime fashion.
- **Hair & Beard:** Long, oily strands cover the entire brow and eye line, while the chin shows a short, unmanaged beard.
- **Expression:** Chronic exhaustion and resignation, even in a neutral pose.

## 2. Outfit
- **Coveralls:** Dark-navy industrial jumpsuit authentic to 1990s Russian factory labor; fabric appears utilitarian and slightly faded.
- **Coat:** Very long matte brown leather trench coat (just above ankles), visibly scuffed, collar permanently raised; matches the strict pixel reference for length and silhouette.
- **Hat:** Tall black wizard hat with a wide circular brim and exaggerated drooping tip; solid matte black with zero ornamentation.
- **Footwear:** Heavy Soviet-style kirzachi work boots, dark and oil-worn.
- **Gloves:** None—hands stay bare to underline the unarmed stance.
- **Palette:** Limited to the pixel reference (pale skin, dark blue jumpsuit, matte brown coat, black hat/boots/hair); forbid folklore motifs or additional accents.

## 3. Character Attributes
- Hands are empty; the character carries no tools, weapons, accessories, or belt attachments.
- Posture should feel defensive yet unarmed, as if bracing for whatever the routine throws next.
- Body language communicates exhaustion and quiet resignation even while standing upright.
- Proportions, shapes, and color blocking must stay faithful to the canonical pixel-art sprite.

## 4. Concept Art Guidelines
- **Presentation:** Full-body, orthographic-friendly T-pose on a pure white background; include only a soft neutral ground shadow—no environment, props, or extra objects.
- **Style Target:** Painterly @akara_kai inspiration but rendered with 3D-looking volumes, simplified readable shapes, and low-poly-aware detail distribution for FPS-ready modeling.
- **Form Language:** Clean silhouettes with tall narrow proportions; the coat and hat define the outline while everything else stays sleek and unembellished.
- **Material Read:** Coat must appear old matte leather, jumpsuit like durable work fabric, hat solid black cloth, and boots heavy rubberized leather; shading should remain subtle for texture callouts.
- **Hair Treatment:** Dark, messy, oily strands fully obscure the eyes at all angles, strengthening the horror tone without revealing pupils.
