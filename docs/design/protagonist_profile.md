# Protagonist Visual Design Brief (Updated)

Alkoldun Vasiliusavich — folk-horror FPS protagonist, a post-Soviet 1990s factory worker whose mundane routine intersects with faint occult undertones.  
The visual design must remain minimalistic, low-poly friendly, and unmistakably grounded in the aesthetics of 1990s Russia.

---

## 1. Morphology

- **Stature:** Real-world average height but presented as a tall, narrow silhouette to match the canonical pixel-art reference.
- **Build:** Normal factory-worker physique — unathletic, not frail, not fat. Unheroic and grounded.
- **Age Impression:** Around 35 years old; visually worn by long-term industrial labor.
- **Skin Tone:** Pale, with the look of someone rarely seeing sunlight.
- **Face:** Angular, tired facial structure; short unmanaged stubble.
- **Eyes:** Fully hidden behind long, messy, oily black hair at all times.
- **Hair:** Greasy strands draping forward over the entire brow and eye line; must obscure the eyes from every angle.
- **Expression:** Neutral but heavy with exhaustion and resignation.

## 2. Outfit (Authentic 1990s Russian Industrial)

- **Jumpsuit:**  
  - Dark navy industrial overalls typical of 1990s Russian factories.  
  - Utilitarian, inexpensive, slightly faded fabric.  
  - Minimal detailing, low-poly friendly folds.

- **Coat:**  
  - Very long matte brown leather trench coat (just above ankles).  
  - Scuffed, worn, slightly stiff but not glossy.  
  - Raised collar.  
  - Clean shape defining the silhouette; no ornamentation.

- **Hat:**  
  - Tall black wizard hat, wide round brim.  
  - A long, soft drooping tip that bends downward from its own weight.  
  - Completely matte, absolutely no decorative elements.  
  - Must remain a consistent silhouette element across art.

- **Boots:**  
  - Black combat boots (bertsy), ankle-height, laced front, thick rubber sole.  
  - NOT tall Soviet kirzachi.

- **Gloves:** None. Hands always bare.

- **Color Palette:**  
  - Strongly limited and practical: pale skin, dark navy jumpsuit, matte brown coat, black hat/boots/hair.  
  - No folklore patterns, no decals, no bright accents.

## 3. Character Attributes

- **Posture:** Upright but drained; conveys chronic fatigue.  
- **Hands:** Empty. No tools, no weapons, no accessories, no belts or pouches.  
- **Silhouette:**  
  - Tall, narrow proportions.  
  - The trench coat and drooping hat tip define the recognizable outline.  
  - Clean, readable geometry appropriate for low-poly modeling.

- **Mood:**  
  - Industrial bleakness and quiet horror.  
  - No dramatic heroism, no energy; subtle tension.

## 4. Concept Art Guidelines (for AI Sketch Generation)

These rules exist specifically to support consistent generation using SDXL / SD3.5 pipelines.

### 4.1 Pose Requirements (Strict T-Pose for Modeling)

- Full-body **neutral T-pose**:  
  - Arms extended horizontally, straight but relaxed (not rigid).  
  - Shoulders level, no dramatic tension.  
  - Palms down or neutral.  
  - Legs straight and parallel.  
- No dynamic posture, no A-pose.  
- The pose must remain anatomically natural to avoid fabric distortion in sleeves.

### 4.2 Presentation

- Pure white background.  
- Soft, neutral ground shadow only.  
- No environment, props, objects, or effects.

### 4.3 Style Target

- Painterly clarity inspired by **@akara_kai**, but simplified for 3D workflow.  
- Low-poly-aware detail distribution.  
- Subtle shading and clean volumes; avoid excessive microdetail.  
- Minimalistic and industrial, grounded in 1990s Russian aesthetics.  
- Materials should read clearly even with simple textures:
  - Coat: matte, worn leather.  
  - Jumpsuit: utilitarian fabric.  
  - Hat: matte black cloth.  
  - Boots: rubberized, sturdy.

### 4.4 Hair Treatment

- Dark, messy, oily strands must obscure the eyes entirely from all angles.  
- No visibility of pupils or whites.

## 5. Purpose of This Design

- Provide a consistent reference for low-poly 3D modeling, rigging, and texturing.  
- Ensure stylistic alignment with the visual direction of *Solidmaid: Alkoldun Vasiliusavich* as described in the GDD.  
- Support reproducible AI-assisted concept iterations without detail creep.

---

## 6. Allowed Deviations (Minor)

- Small variations in fabric folds.  
- Slight differences in coat wear or scuff patterns.  
- Subtle shading interpretations consistent with low-poly readability.

Everything else is fixed by canon.

---

## 7. Forbidden Elements

- Visible eyes or any exposure of brow.  
- Ornamental patterns or folkloric symbols.  
- High-detail realism that breaks low-poly compatibility.  
- Modern or western fashion deviations.  
- Dynamic poses.  
- Bright colors or glossy surfaces.
