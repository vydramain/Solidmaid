# Clear, Reproducible Operating Mode

## I. General Architecture

**Goal:** Master the creation of a complete video game in Godot using C++ plugins through short, iterative cycles.  
**Principle:** Each day should end with a *small, completed action* — not endless tinkering with mechanics. The focus is on practice that delivers tangible results.

## II. Daily Structure

| Stage                   | Time        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Planning              | 10–15 min   | Define **one daily goal** — specific and measurable. Example: “Create a plugin that spawns a cube and rotates it.”                                               |
| 2. Focused Work Session  | 2–4 hours   | Deep, focused work. No multitasking, no browsing forums until you’re blocked.                                                                                     |
| 3. Review and Logging    | 20 min      | Record in `DEVLOG.md`: what you did, what you learned, what didn’t work. Add a commit even if the code isn’t perfect. Each commit must have a meaningful message: `[date] feature: short summary`. |
| 4. Evening Decompression | 30–60 min   | Read others’ source code, documentation, or articles related to the day’s topic. This is not “work,” it’s mental enrichment.                                     |

## III. Productivity and Fatigue Rules

- Maximum 3–4 hours of active development per day.  
- Research is limited strictly to what’s needed for the current task.  
- Even small results must be documented — screenshot, video, or short note.  
- No refactoring for the sake of “cleaner” code. Only when optimization is required.  
- No optimization work until core mechanics are implemented and gameplay feels solid.  
- Problem ≠ failure. If you’re stuck, log it as a separate task for the next day.
