# Before-Work Checklist (≤5 minutes)

1. **Reset context**
   - Skim the latest entry in `docs/devlog/` and the "Next Steps" block.
   - Review the open items in `docs/templates/SESSION_TODO.md` (or copy the template into a fresh session note).
2. **Plan the session**
   - Define the "First Click" and concrete goal for the next 120-minute block.
   - Confirm which milestone/backlog item you are touching in `docs/design/GDD_v2.md`.
3. **Tooling / repo health**
   - Pull latest changes if collaborating; run `git status` to ensure a clean slate.
   - Launch Godot and open the scene you expect to work on (`Sandbox.tscn` for FPS, `Main.tscn` for legacy).
4. **Personal study (optional, see `docs/guides/dev_growth_plan.md`)**
   - If the day includes study time, queue the next chapter in the growth plan before beginning hands-on work.
5. **Start timer**
   - Begin a 110–120 minute focus block; avoid task switching until the planned goal is complete.
