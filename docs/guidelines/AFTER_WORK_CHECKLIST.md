# After-Work Checklist (≤10 minutes)

1. **Stop the timer & build snapshot**
   - Save scenes/scripts in Godot, close playtests.
   - Run quick sanity checks (scene run, lint) if relevant; note failures.
2. **Document**
   - Update today's entry in `docs/devlog/` (Goal, Tasks, Issues, Next Steps).
   - Fill out the "Notes / Decisions" and "Next Session First Click" sections in the active copy of `docs/templates/SESSION_TODO.md`.
3. **Version control**
   - `git status` → stage intentional changes; commit or leave clean instructions in the devlog if work continues tomorrow.
4. **Plan tomorrow**
   - Re-read the backlog/milestone item you are mid-way through and jot down the immediate next action.
   - If study time is planned, note which chapter/article comes next (see `docs/guides/dev_growth_plan.md`).
5. **Shut down context**
   - Close Godot/editor, pause notifications, and mentally log off.
